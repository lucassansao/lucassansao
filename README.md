### Hello, I'm Lucas SansÃ£o!

I decided to change my occupation of over 11 years of working in Maintenance and Electrical Engineering to start a new career in Front-End Web Development.

I've been working and dedicated long enough time to learn about Web Development and become a great professional. I'm ready to acquire new knowledge and skills and Iâ€™m certain that joining your team is a benefit for both sides. Iâ€™m ready for long-time cooperation.
